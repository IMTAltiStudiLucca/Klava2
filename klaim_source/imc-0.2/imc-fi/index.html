<h1>IMC - Implementing Mobile Calculi</h1>

<p>IMC is a Java framework for implementing distributed applications
possibly with code mobility. The name is due to the fact that originally
this framework was built for helping implementing the run time system of
mobile calculi implementation, i.e., calculi accessing remote resources
and nodes, and, possibly, exchanging code, processes and mobile agents.
Of course, if you don't need code mobility features you can simply
ignore them and use IMC for building any distributed and network
application.</p>

<p>IMC is Open Source and Free Software, under <a href="COPYING">GPL</a>.</p>

<p>NOTICE: IMC is targetted to programmers of distributed
application, not to end users.</p>

<p>IMC is developed at <a href="http://www.dsi.unifi.it">Dipartimento
di Sistemi e Informatica, Universita' di Firenze, Italy</a> from <a
	href="http://music.dsi.unifi.it"> the Concurrency and Mobility
Group</a>.</p>

<p><font color="green">IMC uses generics, thus it requires Java 5.</font></p>

<p><font color="red">IMC is still in development state, thus
some parts are likely to change in future versions.</font></p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>Many implementations of mobile code languages have been proposed,
and very often the language used for implementation is Java because it
provides many useful features for building network applications with
mobile code. However, these Java mechanisms still require a big
programming effort, and so they can be thought of as "low-level"
mechanisms. Because of this, many existing Java-based distributed
systems tend to re-implement from scratch many components that are
typical and recurrent in distributed and mobile applications.</p>

<p>To support the implementation of languages for global computing,
we have been working on IMC that can be used as a framework for the
implementation of different distributed mobile systems. Such a framework
aims at providing the necessary tools for implementing new language
run-time systems directly derived from calculi for mobility. The basic
idea and motivation of this framework is that the implementer of a new
language would need concentrating on the parts that are really specific
of his system, while relying on the framework for the recurrent standard
mechanisms. The development of prototype implementations should then be
quicker and the programmers should be relieved from dealing with
low-level details. The proposed framework aims at providing all the
required functionalities and abstractions for arbitrary components to
communicate and move in a distributed setting.</p>

<p>IMC provides concrete implementations for the standard and most
used functionalities that should fit most Java mobile framework
requirements (e.g., Java byte-code mobility and standard network
communication mechanisms). A user of IMC can customize parts of the
framework by providing its own implementations for the interfaces used
in the package. In this respect, the IMC framework can be
straightforwardly used if no specific advanced feature is needed. The
framework is however open to customizations if these are required by
specific mobility systems. Customization of the framework can be
achieved by taking advantage of design patterns that are used throughout
the packages.</p>

<p>The framework was designed to achieve both <em>transparency</em>
and <em>adaptability</em>. For instance, for code mobility, the
framework provides all the basic functionalities for making code
mobility transparent to the programmer: all issues related to code
marshalling and code dispatch are handled automatically by the classes
of the framework. Its components are designed to deal with object
marshalling, code migration, and dynamic loading of code. The framework
can also be adapted to deal with many network topologies (flat,
hierarchical, peer-to-peer networks, etc.) and with message dispatching
and forwarding. Furthermore, the implementer can build his own
communication protocols by specializing the protocol base classes
provided by the framework. Thus, the developer will only have to
implement the parts that are relevant to the system he wants to build:
typically, he will develop the communication protocol which best matches
application-specific requirements. Connections and network topology are
dealt with directly from within the framework. However, the developer
may access the current state of his application with listeners to events
that the classes of the framework generate.</p>

<h2>Download &amp; Installation</h2>

<p>IMC can be downloaded from the site: <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/imc-fi">http://sourceforge.net/projects/imc-fi</a>
</p>

<p>Of couse, being an open source software, IMC comes with sources
(although the archive contains also the precompiled binaries). In
particular, the archive you download consists of the following (main)
directories:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>bin</strong> - contains the precompiled .class files
	for all the sources (including examples and junit tests). Probably, the
	only binaries you'll need are the ones in the org subdirectory
	representing the binaries of the framework itself.</li>
	<li><strong>src</strong> - contains the sources of the framework
	itself.</li>
	<li><strong>doc</strong> - contains the Javadoc documentation of
	the classes of the framework.</li>
	<li><strong>examples</strong> - contains the sources of the
	examples.</li>
	<li><strong>tests</strong> - contains the sources of the junit
	tests.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p>You can also access IMC's sources through the CVS repository,
which contains the most up-to-date version of the framework (you can
also browse the repository via the <a
	href="http://imc-fi.cvs.sourceforge.net/imc-fi">web-based
repository viewer</a>). You can retrieve the sources through from the CVS
repository using the following commands:</p>
<pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@imc-fi.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/imc-fi login
 
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@imc-fi.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/imc-fi co -P imc
</pre>
<p>Further Information about accessing this CVS repository may be
found in the document titled, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/docs/E04/">"CVS
(Version Control for Source Code)"</a> .</p>

<p>If you're an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> user
you might also import the project from CVS, or, if you downloaded the
source archive you can import the project you find in the archive. In
this case you can also run the junit tests from Eclipse (the test suite
is called <tt>AllTests</tt>).</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>Apart from the above mentioned javadoc documentation, from <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/imc-fi">http://sourceforge.net/projects/imc-fi</a>,
you can download the user guide (which contains many examples of
tutorial nature).</p>

IMC has been employed for developing a Java prototype implementation of
a run-time system for the distributed Pi calculus,
<a href="http://music.dsi.unifi.it/jdpi">JDpi</a>.
Furthermore it is being used to re-engineer the current implementation of
<a href="http://music.dsi.unifi.it/klaim">Klava</a>, the run-time system for
Klaim.

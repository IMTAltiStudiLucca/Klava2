The access to Marshaler and UnMarshaler should be synchronized?

IncomingConnectionState and ConnectionState factory to customize
the connection protocol.

readStringLine with termination chars and escape char.

LinePrinterLayer should be a tunnel to dump the lines
we read and the lines we print.

MultiPlexerProtocolLayer e DeMultiPlexerProtocolLayer

A specialized exception for already bound addresses and sockets

test the errors in putget and sequence number layers.

automatic test for linda

test failures with tunnel (bad request)

find a way to specify the UDP packet length

The transmissionChannel should be shared by all the states of
a protocol.  Implement this in Protocol class.

Find a way to define the end of a message, so that a message
can be easily forwarded to another host, in a uniform way.

ProtocolState should have a reference to the Protocol, not to
the stack.

up, down, prepare in ProtocolLayer?

Should ProtocolSwitchState clear the input if found an unknown request?

ServerSide the SessionId has 0.0.0.0

Established connections in ConnectionMonitor are not updated
when one is removed.

SessionStarterTable is duplicated in Node and ConnectionServer/ConnectionStarter.

Add EventManager interface to NodeCoordinatorProxy and NodeCoordinator,
and in NodeTest use directly the interface of Node.

Document ProtocolLayerSharedBuffer
Document getUnMarshaler and getMarshaler in ProtocolStateSimple

ConnectionStarter and ConnectionServer should be named using Session
instead of Connection.

getNodeStack could substituted with the RoutingTable.

createUnMarshaler in ProtocolLayer, etc., should check that the ProtocolStack is not null.

Node: should store all the processes that it has spawned, to be
able to terminate them all when closing node?
The container should be passed to the process itself so that it
can remove its own reference upon termination.

In the implementation of releaseUnMarshaler set a sort of flag in
the UnMarshaler saying that you can't read anymore?

update the examples and tests with releaseUnMarshaler.

Insert addExcludeClass to the NodeClassLoader.

SessionStarter: a base class for TcpSessionStarter and UdpSessionStarter

SessionId in SessionStarter base class (not an interface anymore)

ConnectionStarter and ConnectionServer are really needed?

usedForAccept and usedForConnect in SessionStarter

EventViewer (in a list, where you decide which events you want to collect)
UDP client on closing should send a packet notifying the server
that it closed, otherwise the server cannot realize it.

ProtocolLayerComposite: modify the stack and manually insert the two sublayers
in the place of the composite one.  UdpTests fails.

It would be better to associate a Session a ProtocolStack instead of
a layer, so that when close is invoked, all the layers belonging to the
stack are called.

Define NodeProcessCollector e NodeCoordinatorCollector inheriting from ProcessCollector

tests for mark, reset and skip in UnMarshaler.

tests for WaitForEvent listeners.

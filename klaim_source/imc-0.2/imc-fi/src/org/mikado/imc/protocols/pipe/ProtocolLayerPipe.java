/**
 * A pair of ProtocolLayers in pipe. What is written in the first layer is
 * available for reading from the other layer, and viceversa.
 * 
 * As suggesed in the Java documentation for piped stream: <i>"Attempting to use
 * both objects from a single thread is not recommended, as it may deadlock the
 * thread."</i>
 * 
 * This can be for testing purposes, including at least two threads.
 * 
 * It is also used by LocalSessionStarter, that creates a session using local
 * pipes.
 * 
 * Notice that for the implementation of pipes we did NOT use PipedInputStream
 * and PipedOutputStream from java.io, since if the thread that writes into the
 * pipe dies, the other thread receives a broken pipe exception, even if the
 * pipe could still be used (see <a
 * href=http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=606530&amp;messageID=3296245>this
 * discussion</a> and
 * <a href=http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4028322>this bug report</a>).
 * Since IMC is thought to be used with many threads this cannot be acceptable,
 * especially when dealing with sessions.
 * 
 * Thus we resorted java.nio.Pipe, which seems to work fine.
